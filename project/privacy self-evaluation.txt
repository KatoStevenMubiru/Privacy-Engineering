1. Proactive not Reactive; Preventative not Remedial:
What the application does: The application takes a proactive approach to privacy by incorporating privacy features from the beginning. It includes measures like secret ballot generation, redaction of personally identifiable information (PII), and fraud detection during ballot counting.
Improvement: Continuous monitoring and improvement of privacy features can be implemented. Regularly update and enhance privacy protocols based on emerging threats and technologies.
2. Privacy as the Default Setting:
What the application does: The application ensures privacy by default, incorporating privacy features into the core functionality. It emphasizes anonymity in ballot casting, redacts PII from comments, and limits data retention to essential information.
Improvement: Ensure that any future features or updates also default to privacy-conscious settings. Regularly review and update default settings to align with evolving privacy standards.
3. Privacy Embedded into Design:
What the application does: Privacy considerations are embedded into the design, such as the issuance of secret ballots, redaction of PII from comments, and the implementation of fraud detection during ballot counting.
Improvement: Conduct regular privacy impact assessments during the development lifecycle. Explore opportunities to further integrate privacy measures seamlessly into the application architecture.
4. Full Functionality — Positive-Sum, not Zero-Sum:
What the application does: Privacy features are integrated without compromising the functionality of the election system. Voters can securely cast their votes, and fraud detection is implemented without hindering the election process.
Improvement: Strive for innovative solutions that enhance both functionality and privacy. Regularly seek feedback from users to balance usability with privacy requirements.
5. End-to-End Security — Full Lifecycle Protection:
What the application does: The application considers privacy and security throughout the entire lifecycle, from ballot issuance to counting. It implements measures like secret ballot generation, PII redaction, and fraud detection.
Improvement: Regularly update security protocols to address emerging threats. Consider additional encryption measures and data anonymization techniques to enhance end-to-end protection.
6. Visibility and Transparency — Keep it Open:
What the application does: The application maintains transparency by informing voters about the anonymity of their ballots, the redaction of PII from comments, and the consequences of fraud detection.
Improvement: Enhance transparency by providing users with detailed information about how their data is handled, stored, and secured. Implement features like privacy dashboards to give users insight into their privacy settings.
7. Respect for User Privacy — Keep it User-Centric:
What the application does: The application respects user privacy by allowing them to cast secret ballots, redact PII from comments, and informing them about the consequences of fraud detection.
Improvement: Implement more user-centric features, such as allowing users to easily access and manage their data. Provide clear and accessible privacy policies to ensure users understand how their data is handled.
